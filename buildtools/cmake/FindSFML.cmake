# SFML_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against 
# SFML_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SFML 
# SFML_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SFML headers 
# 
# Created by Nils Hasenbanck. Based on the FindSDL_*.cmake modules, 
# created by Eric Wing, which were influenced by the FindSDL.cmake 
# module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and 
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
